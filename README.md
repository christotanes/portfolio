# Capstone 1 Personal portfolio project

### [Link to github pages](https://christotanes.github.io/web-portfolio/)

This was the very first site I made that was published. 

It's a single page app made with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap as required to pass the Front end course of Zuitt.

In the future, I am hoping to update the portfolio with JavaScript and other CSS effects.
